Libraries for Machine Learning
==============================

For your reference, here are all the libraries we went over in the video. This is a lot of info; you should not feel like you need to be deeply knowledgable about every detail of these libraries. Rather, we suggest that you become familiar with what each library is _for_, in general terms. For example, if you hear someone talking about _matplotlib_, it would be good for you to recognize that this is a popular library for data visualization. Or if you see a reference to _TensorFlow_, it would be good to recognize this as a popular machine learning library.

**Core Framework and Tools**

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a very popular high-level programming language that is great for data science. Its ease of use and wide support within popular machine learning platforms, coupled with a large catalog of ML libraries, has made it a leader in this space.
*   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open-source Python library designed for analyzing and manipulating data. It is particularly good for working with tabular data and time-series data.
*   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), like Pandas, is a Python library. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays of data, and has many high-level mathematical functions that can be used to perform operations on these arrays.

**Machine Learning and Deep Learning**

*   [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a Python library designed specifically for machine learning. It is designed to be integrated with other scientific and data-analysis libraries, such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (described below).
*   [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is an open-source analytics engine that is designed for [cluster-computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster) and that is often used for large-scale data processing and [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data).
*   [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a free, open-source software library for machine learning built by [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain).
*   [Keras](https://keras.io/) is a Python deep-learning library. It provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used to interface with other libraries, such as TensorFlow, in order to program neural networks. Keras is designed for rapid development and experimentation.
*   [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source library for machine learning, developed in large part by [Facebook's AI Research lab](https://ai.facebook.com/). It is known for being comparatively easy to use, especially for developers already familiar with Python and a [Pythonic code style](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean).

**Data Visualization**

*   [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) is not itself a library, but rather a company that provides a number of different front-end tools for machine learning and data scienceâ€”including an [open source graphing library for Python](https://plotly.com/python/).
*   [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a Python library designed for plotting 2D visualizations. It can be used to produce graphs and other figures that are high quality and usable in professional publications. You'll see that the Matplotlib library is used by a number of other libraries and tools, such as SciKit Learn (above) and Seaborn (below). You can easily import Matplotlib for use in a Python script or to create visualizations within a Jupyter Notebook.
*   [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python library designed specifically for data visualization. It is based on matplotlib, but provides a more high-level interface and has additional features for making visualizations more attractive and informative.
*   [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) is an interactive data visualization library. In contrast to a library like matplotlib that generates a static image as its output, Bokeh generates visualizations in HTML and JavaScript. This allows for web-based visualizations that can have interactive features.
